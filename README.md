(give heroku a minute to spin up the app)

This is just a little exercise in backend concepts (CRUD, MVC, populating view templates, etc.) with node/express.

This project is based on an MDN express tutorial. It's a basic library database system that allows you to **c**reate, **r**ead, **u**pdate and **d**elete books, copies of books, authors, and genres. It's using Express and Mongoose (MongoDB), and the templating engine is Handlebars. Since it's just a demo it doesn't have authentication, so anyone can grief the database. :)
